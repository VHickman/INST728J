Hello, my name is Valerie Hickman. I am an MLIS major and am taking the class to improve upon the HTML and CSS skills I learned taking LBSC 671 - Creating Information Infrastructures. I currently volunteer as a Photographic Aid at the Smithsonian Archives where I digitize old photographs from the Smithsonian Torch newsletter from the 70's and 80's. I scan the photographs and aggregate data from logbook records, pull a caption from the Torch magazine, and reconcile the item with legacy records in the Smithsonian’s database.
Some of my favorite foods include lemon poppy seed muffins, cinnamon rolls, and biscuits and gravy. I do not generally like soda, but I do drink lots of tea and coffee. When drinking coffee, I often substitute sugar and milk for erythritol and coconut cream for a healthier alternative.
I also have a pet dog named Bubby, who is a ten year old male Lhasa Apso. He is a very low-energy dog who does not need a lot of exercise which is great for me as an owner because I do not have a lot of time to take him on long walks. Instead, Bubby likes to sit on my lap while I do schoolwork, which is perfect.
