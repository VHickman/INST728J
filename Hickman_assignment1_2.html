<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Valerie Hickman. I am an MLIS major and am taking the class to improve upon the HTML and CSS skills I learned taking LBSC 671 - Creating Information Infrastructures. I currently volunteer as a Photographic Aid at the Smithsonian Archives where I digitize old photographs from the Smithsonian Torch newsletter from the 70's and 80's. I scan the photographs and aggregate data from logbook records, pull a caption from the Torch magazine, and reconcile the item with legacy records in the Smithsonianâ€™s database.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite foods include lemon poppy seed muffins, cinnamon rolls, and biscuits and gravy. I do not generally like soda, but I do drink lots of tea and coffee. When drinking coffee, I often substitute sugar and milk for erythritol and coconut cream for a healthier alternative.</p>
<p>I also have a pet dog named Bubby, who is a ten year old male Lhasa Apso. He is a very low-energy dog who does not need a lot of exercise which is great for me as an owner because I do not have a lot of time to take him on long walks. Instead, Bubby likes to sit on my lap while I do schoolwork, which is perfect.
